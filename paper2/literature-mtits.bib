  abstract                 = {{T}he intrinsic geographical distribution and the increasing complexity are two significant properties of modern business processes ({BP}s) that have not been fully addressed by existing simulation tools for {BP} analysis. {Q}uantitative analysis of {BP}s is essential both at design time, to predict the {BP} quality of service ({Q}o{S}), and at execution time, to dynamically reconfigure the {BP} and guarantee the pre-agreed {Q}o{S}. {I}n this respect, this work proposes a model-driven {Q}o{S}-aware framework for simulation-based quantitative analysis of {BP}s. {S}pecifically, the framework adopts a distributed simulation approach that replicates the service-oriented infrastructure of a {BP} into the corresponding simulation infrastructure based on the {HLA}-{E}volved standard. {T}he proposed framework assumes a scenario in which service providers publish a set of simulation-oriented services that can be subsequently used by interested consumers to dynamically discover and evaluate the {Q}o{S} of the offered services. {K}ey to the economical feasibility of this scenario is that a model-driven approach is used to automate the derivation of the simulation software from the {BPMN} ({B}usiness {P}rocess {M}odel & {N}otation) models of the actual {BP}s. {T}he paper presents both the proposed model-driven framework, named 4{SEE}, and an example application to a {BP} for an e-commerce scenario.},

  abstract                 = {{T}he development of complex systems requires the use of quantitative analysis techniques to allow a design-time evaluation of the system behavior. {I}n this context, distributed simulation ({DS}) techniques can be effectively introduced to assess whether or not the system satisfies the user requirements. {U}nfortunately, the development of a {DS} requires the availability of an {IT} infrastructure that could not comply with time-to-market requirements and budget constraints. {I}n this respect, this work introduces {HLA}cloud, a model-driven and cloud-based framework to support both the implementation of a {DS} system from a {S}ys{ML} specification of the system under study and its execution over a public cloud infrastructure. {T}he proposed approach, which exploits the {HLA} ({H}igh {L}evel {A}rchitecture) {DS} standard, is founded on the use of model transformation techniques to generate both the {J}ava/{HLA} source code of the {DS} system and the scripts required to deploy and execute the {HLA} federation onto the {P}lanet{L}ab cloud-based infrastructure.},

  abstract                 = {{T}here is an increasing need for systematic composition of simulation services in the emerging service-oriented computing environment. {A}n important issue that hinders simulation service composition is the mismatch of granularity when coupling two services together. {I}n this paper, we focus on time granularity and event granularity in composing simulation services at the pragmatic level. {W}e identify and develop four types of granularity handling agents to be associated with the couplings between services. {T}he developed method is illustrated by a coupled weather-wildfire simulation example.},

  abstract                 = {{T}he cloud computing paradigm promises a cost-effective solution for running applications. {E}fforts are been making by simulation practitioners to plant {P}arallel {D}iscrete {E}vent {S}imulation ({PDES}) applications into a {S}imulation as a {S}ervice cloud. {T}o this end, a parallel job scheduler customized for {PDES} jobs is urgently needed as currently widely used parallel job scheduler such as {FCFS} and backfilling can not fit in with {PDES} jobs well due to: 1) {FCFS} suffers a severe processor fragmentation and 2) users can not estimate the runtime of a {PDES} job running in the cloud for backfilling. {I}n this paper, in order to address these problems, we utilize the cheap price for {PDES} job migration implemented by checkpointing, and device a migration-based {PDES} job scheduling algorithm ({AMSA}) to eliminate the need of runtime estimation and to improve the processor utilization as well. {S}imulation results on well-known workload models show that {AMSA} produces a significant improvement on utilization, response time and slow down in contrast to {FCFS}. {M}oreover even with a migration up to 3600 seconds, {AMSA} still beats {FCFS} to certain extend. {I}n summary, our algorithm improves the profit of the cloud provider on the one hand, and satisfies the users on the other hand.},

  abstract                 = {{T}his paper evaluates the implications of model theory for agent languages. {T}he tasks of ambassador agents are to represent simulations and identify potential contributions, select the best solutions in light of the question, compose the selected best solutions to provide the new functionality, and orchestrate their execution. {M}odel-based data engineering can help to identify the information that needs to be exchanged between systems, existential and transformational dependencies can be identified using graph theory, and {P}etri nets can represent the availability of required information. {A}ll structures can be computed and fall under the realm of formal languages. {M}odel theory is a subset of mathematics that focuses on the study of formal languages and their interpretations. {I}nterpreting the terms model, simulation, and data of the modeling and simulation community using model theoretic terms allows the application of model theoretic insights. {T}his allows to formally and unambiguously capture requirements for interoperability and composability.},
